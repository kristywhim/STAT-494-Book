# Introduction to statistical genetics

Statistical Genetics is a subject and field of study investigating how variation in genome associates people's research of interests by statistical methods. Through this tiny bookdown, we will explore a tiny subfield of statistical genetics:*Genome wide association studies (GWAS)*. It is one of the most popular statistical tools. The method investigates a type of genetic variants, called *SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism)*, and its associations with the trait of interest. The trait can be either binary (for example, if a person is affected by a disease), or quantitative (for example, body weight/ height).

In chapter 1, we will learn the context of Genome-wide association studies, and its basics.
In chapter 2, we will explore the effect of population, ancestry and how that related to GWAS application and analysis.
